# NHL'94 Fonts

The 94-Sega .ttf font was made by Clockwise in 2006. I think someone may have updated it a little at some point. It has a problem with the apostrophe.

The 94-SNES .ttf font was made by KingRaph using https://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/ . Consider remaking the Sega version using this, to fix the apostrophe.

Here is a MineCraft monospace font made with FontForge that could maybe be used as a template for future fonts: https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft
